* Issues in OSEK Conformance Tests *

  OSEK-OS specifies the conformance tests over the MODISTAR specification which
  can be found under:

  http://portal.osek-vdx.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15&Itemid=18

  These tests have been written for OSEK-OS 2.0.0 but the last OSEK-OS version
  is the 2.2.3. This OSEK-OS is implemented conform to 2.2.3 and therefore some
  test cases can not executed.

  ** Task Management **

  The interface GetTaskID never returns E_OS_CALLEVEL which is required in the
  test sequence 1 test case 37.

  ** Resource Management **

   *** Test Sequence 2 ***

  The sequence 2 of resource management tests requests to force a schedule
  while a resource is occupied. This is not allowed in 2.2.3, Schedule returns
  E_OS_RESOURCE if called while a resurce is still occupied.

   *** Test Sequence 5 ***

  GetResource and ReleaseResource can be called from ISR2 context. But the test
  sequence 5 test case 3 and 10 requires these interfaces to return
  E_OS_CALLEVEL when called from ISR2 context.

  ** Interrupt Processing **

  The sequence 2 of the Interrupt Processing test can not be implemented, the
  interface EnableInterrupt and DisableInterrupt are not more part of the
  standard. The following interfaces are aviable for the handling of
  interrupts:

  * DisableAllInterrupt/EnableAllInterrupt
  * SuspendAllInterrupt/ResumeAllInterrupt
  * SuspendOsInterrupt/ResumeOsInterrupt

  All this interfaces have void a return type. The test checks the return of
  this interfaces which is not possible since it is void.
